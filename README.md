# Readme
I prepared this as a pet project, in part to learn how to structure a cls specification, and in part to get used to some packages I never used. 
This document requires LuaLaTeX to compile several fonts that are freely avaiable: [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans), [Noto Sans JP](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP), and [Noto Sans Mono](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono).
This document class provides a simple memo for LaTeX users styled for Tohoku University. It is based on article.cls and inherits most of the functionality that class.
It is based in part on the work the project by Rob Oakes, [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/memo-template/xfgfwnxzcgkf)

If you compile the file you may notice that 2 image files are missing - these have been omitted for copyright purposes. Feel free to substitute the logo and figure with your own favourite pictures.
