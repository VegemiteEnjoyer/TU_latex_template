  abstract = {It is important to determine the relationship between tsunami flow characteristics and structural vulnerability. In order to develop tsunami fragility curves with particular regard to tsunami flow velocities and hydrodynamic forces, the authors used the results of numerical modeling with the validation of the tsunami front and flow velocities. Three tsunami fragility curves were constructed for each structural type (Wooden, Steel and RC) in Sendai to identify the structural vulnerabilities. We found wooden houses were especially vulnerable when the inundation depth exceeded 3 m, the flow velocity exceeded 3 m/s or hydrodynamic load exceeded 20 kN/m.},
